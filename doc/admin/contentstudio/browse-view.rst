The **Browse view** is the default page of the Content Studio. It consists of a menu bar on top and two or three panels below it. On the
left is the :ref:`content_tree` where all the sites and content can be found. To the right of the tree grid is the :ref:`preview_panel`
which displays a preview of the selected content. On the far right is the :ref:`detail_panel` that may be toggled on and off with the |detailicon| icon
in the top right corner.
