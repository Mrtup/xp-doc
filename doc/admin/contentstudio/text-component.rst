Text component
==============

.. NOTE::
   This section is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

The Text component allows content editors to place and format text into any region on a page without writing any code. Images can also be
added inside text components. Macros allow Twitter tweets, YouTube videos, embedded code, and no-format text to be added as well. The
formatting and macro options are the same as those for the HtmlArea inputs that can be found in content types and other configuration forms
in the Content Studio. The only difference is that the formatting toolbar is at the top of the page for text components.

In the :ref:`page_editor`, drag a Text component from the inspect panel to the desired region on the page. A cursor will appear inside the
text component and editing can begin. If another component is selected, the text component will need to be double-clicked to resume editing.
