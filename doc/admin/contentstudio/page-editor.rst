Page Editor
===========

The page editor is a modifiable preview of the content page that will open automatically when a content that has a supporting page template
is created or edited. It is used in conjunction with the :ref:`context_panel` to add, remove, and move components around the page with
drag and drop. The page editor can be closed and reopened with the icon on the far right of the toolbar that looks like a computer monitor.

A component can be selected in the page editor by clicking on it. This will highlight the selected component and show its configuration in
the inspect panel. Right-clicking a component will open a context menu with various actions that can be performed on the component. These
options may include **Select parent**, **Insert** another component, **Inspect** its configuration, **Reset** the component's configuration,
**Remove** the component, **Duplicate** it, and **Create fragment** from the component.

The page editor will not automatically open if the type of content being edited does not have a supporting page template. However, it can be
opened manually and a dropdown selector will appear which can be used to add a **page component** to render a page. Read more about this in the
:ref:`page_templates` section.
