=============

The dialog with issue details can be open from the :ref:`issue_list` or via direct link from an email confirmation sent to assignees.
It will also open automatically after a new issue is created.
By default the dialog is in read-only mode and shows issue title, id, brief summary, status, description, assignees and the list of contents.
Use |backicon| in the top left corner to go back to the :ref:`issue_list`.

"Edit Issue" button in the bottom-left corner can be used to switch the issue to :ref:`edit mode <issue_modify>` and make changes to it.
Pressing the "Publish" button will publish all of the items in the issue along with their dependencies and - optionally - child items.
After an issue is published its status will change from Open to Closed and user will be redirected back to the issue list.
Both creator of the issue and all of the assignees will be notified by email that the issue was published and closed.
