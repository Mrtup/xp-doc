Content tree grid
=================

The content tree lists all the content that the logged in user has `read access` to. Content can be organized and stored in a hierarchy with
child content collapsed under parent content. Parent content will have a gray triangle to the left of the content icon that can be clicked
to expand or collapse the view of its children. The content tree can also be navigated with the keyboard arrow keys. The top of the content
tree has buttons to select all displayed content, clear selected content and refresh the tree.

Information about the content is displayed in three columns. The first column has an icon based on the type of content. A gray triangle will
appear to the left of the icon if the content has children content. The first column also has a display name and under this is the path
name. The URL path to any content can be determined by following the tree grid path names from parent to child. The second column shows the
status of the content which will be Offline, Online or Modified. The third column shows the date that content was last modified.

If current user has **only** read access to a content item, such item will be slightly dimmed in the grid.

Checkboxes to the left of each content in the tree can be used to select more than one content. Group actions available in the menu bar will
be performed on all the selected content. Some actions can only be performed on one content at a time.

Double-click on a content item will open it for edit in a new browser tab.

Right-click on a content item will expand its context menu.
