.. _duplicate:

Duplicate
=========

This action will make a copy of the selected content and add "-copy" to the duplicate's path name. The only other difference between the
original and duplicate will be the content ID. Even the **Created** and **Modified** dates will be the same. This option is disabled when
more than one content is selected in the tree grid.

When used from inside the Edit view, "Duplicate" function will open a new browser tab for the copy of the content and switch to that tab.
