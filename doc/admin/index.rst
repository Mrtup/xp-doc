If this is a test-installation, you can login with **su** / **password**.

**Language**

   The tools of the admin console have been translated to several languages, and will try to match the language settings of your browser.
   If a translation is not found, the admin console will default to English.
   If you know and use a language that is not supported, we would greatly appreciate help with translating the admin console to mor
   languages.  Please checkout out our guide on :ref:`language_contribution`.
