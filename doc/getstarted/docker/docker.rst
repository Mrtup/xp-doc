Install Docker
==============

Running Enonic XP with Docker actually requires access to a Docker container - now, that's a surprise!

If you don't already have a Docker up and running, we recommend reading the brilliant documentation on how to get started with Docker:

  * `Docker for Windows <http://docs.docker.com/windows/started/>`_
  * `Docker for OSX <http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/>`_
  * `Docker for Linux <http://docs.docker.com/linux/started/>`_
