My First App
************
*This guide will lead you through the required steps to build the "Hello World" app for Enonic XP*

In this tutorial, you will learn how to initialize new application projects and deploy them. We will create a simple website that displays a
list of countries and cities with a Google map of each city. Upon completion, you will be familiar with content types, page and part
components, page templates, regions, and the Content Manager app. You won't be writing any code - just copy/paste from the examples.

.. NOTE::

  To complete this tutorial, you will need a local running installation
  (see :ref:`getting-started-installation`) of Enonic XP and a text editor of your choice.
  All terminal actions assume you're using OSX or Linux.
