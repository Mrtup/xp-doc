Now that your "Hello World" is complete, it's time to publish.

#. Select the "Hello World" site in the content pane
#. Right-click and select "Publish" from the context menu, or click the "Publish" button in the toolbar
#. The Publishing Wizard will appear. Check the "Include children" checkbox
#. Verify that all your items are listed  - click "Publish"!

When publishing content, all the selected items and changes are "cloned" from draft to the master branch (:ref:`node-domain-repository`).

You will always see the draft version of content in the preview window and the Page Editor of the Content Studio.
If you have placed your site on root level, you can also see your live site at this url:
``http://localhost:8080/portal/master/hello-world``.

things you will make and are always looking for `feedback <https://discuss.enonic.com>`_.
