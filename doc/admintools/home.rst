Upon successful login, the Home page appears as seen in the image below. The installed admin tools are listed in the **Launcher Panel** on
the right. The space on the left is reserved for future use. The footer has the software version and links to the forum
and documentation. The bottom of the Launcher Panel has the name of the logged in user and a logout button.

Future releases will include more functionality for the Home Tool.
