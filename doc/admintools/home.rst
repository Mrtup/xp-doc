Launcher panel
--------------

The launcher panel lists the installed admin tools in alphabetical order. These will open in a new tab when selected, but holding the
left-click will cause the selected tool to open in the same tab. The bottom of the Launcher Panel has the name of the logged in user and a
logout button.
