Image content
=============

.. NOTE::
   This page is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

An image content is created when an image file is uploaded. Storing images as content allows them to be indexed for searches and have the
same language and security settings as other content. Image content items have fields for Caption, Artist, Copyright, Tags and Text. Image
content also has fields that are automatically filled in with any Exif data the image file contains. The image file itself can be swapped
out with the upload button or by dragging a file onto the image. Images can be cropped and a focal point can be added in the editor.

Cropping
--------

Clicking the crop icon (above the image) will darken the page outside of the image preview and the editing tools. The zoom slider will make
the preview larger and parts of the image will extend into the dark regions of the page. The image can be moved by clicking and dragging it
around. The aspect ratio can be changed by clicking and dragging the circle (arrows icon) at the bottom of the picture. Make the necessary
adjustments so that the part of the picture you want to keep is within the highlighted area. The **Apply** button will restore the page to
normal edit mode.

Focal point
-----------

Images can be displayed on a web page with a different aspect ratio than the original. When this happens, the top and bottom or the left and
right edges of the picture will be automatically cropped. This can cause the subject of the image to be lost. For example, the heads of
people in a portrait image could be cut off when the image is rendered with a landscape ratio. Setting a focal point on an image ensures
that the subject will always be in the picture, no matter the ratio used to render it.

Click the focal point icon. A red circle appears in the center of the image preview. Click on the part of the picture that you want to
always keep in frame and then click the Apply button. Once a focal point is set, its location will be marked with a red circle when the
content is in edit mode.
