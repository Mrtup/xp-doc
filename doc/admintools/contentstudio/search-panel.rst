Search Panel
============

The search panel can be toggled with the magnifying glass icon at the far left of the menu bar. When opened, it has a text search field and
categories to limit search results by Content Types and Last Modified. All content will match an empty search field.

Search results are instantly updated in the tree grid as search parameters are changed. Children of matching content will also exist in the
tree grid but won't be visible unless the parent is expanded with the triangle.

The number of hits will appear below the search field, along with a **Clear** button that will remove all search parameters.

Each content type that has at least one matching content will appear in the Content Types list with the number of matches in parenthesis ().
Checking the box next to a content type will remove the results that do not match that type. Multiple content types can be "checked".

The Last Modified list works in a similar manner. It is used to limit results to content that has been modified in the last month, week, day
or hour. This list may not appear if other search parameters have limited results to content that was modified more than a month ago.

.. tip::
   Search results remain in the tree grid when the search panel is closed. Don't forget to clear the search when finished with it.
