Component View
==============

This tool opens in a draggable internal window. It displays a hierarchical tree representation of all the components on the page, including
the page itself. This tool is extremely valuable in situations where an unconfigured component does not render or is very small and
difficult to find in the page editor. Selecting a component in the tree will display its configuration in the inspection panel **Inspect
tab**. The triangle on the right of each component will open a menu of options that can be selected for the component.
