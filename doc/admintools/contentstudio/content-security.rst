Content Security
================

.. NOTE::
   This page is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

Users with the right permissions can edit a content's security settings to manage who can create, read, modify, delete, and publish content.
Security of content is determined by the principals added to the content's security settings. Principals are the **Users**, **Groups** and
**Roles** that are themselves managed in the :ref:`users_tool` admin tool. Content that has the role **Everyone** with the **Read**
permission is accessible to the public - meaning it can be read by users who are not logged in. Content without the **Everyone** role can
only be read by users who are logged into the site.
