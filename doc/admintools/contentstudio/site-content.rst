Site Content
============

.. NOTE::
   This page is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

Sites are created at the root level of the tree grid from a special built-in content type represented by a globe icon. Every site content
will have a **Templates** folder which is automatically created along with the site content. Sites are built with components and content
that are defined in application code. Sites will need one or more apps that have at least one page component before any rendering can
happen. The content edit panel of a site content has a dropdown selector for adding apps. The **applications** selector will list all of the
apps that have been installed. Once an app is added to a site content, it appears in the content edit panel with its display name, app name,
and icons for removing and editing the app configuration. Click the pencil icon to see and update the configuration.
