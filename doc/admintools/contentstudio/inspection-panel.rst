Inspection Panel
================

.. NOTE::
   This section is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

This panel is a multi-function tool that can be toggled open and closed with the cog icon at the right of the toolbar. It is used in
conjunction with the **Page Editor** to add and configure components on the page and to emulate various device sizes.The inspection panel
has three tabs: Insert, Inspect, and Emulator.

Insert tab
----------

This tab has a list of component types that can be added to the page in a two step process. The first step is to drag and drop a component
type placeholder to a region in the page editor. The second step is to select the specific component from a combo-box selector in the
placeholder.

For example, to add a part component called "Categories" to the page, simply click the part icon (puzzle piece) and drag it to a region in
the page editor. A red circle appears when the component is dragged over an area where it cannot be dropped. A green checkbox appears when
dragged over valid locations and a blue box shows where the component will land. Once the part placeholder is dropped, it will have a
combo-box where the "Categories" part can be selected from the list.

Inspect tab
-----------

This is where components are configured. The inspection panel displays form inputs matching the configuration of whichever component is
selected in the page editor. The page does not update as configuration values change until the changes are applied with the button at the
bottom of the panel, or the content is saved.

When a component placeholder is selected, a combo-box appears with all the available components for that
placeholder's type.

Emulator tab
------------

This tab has buttons for emulating various sized devices. The page editor will shrink and expand to fit the selected device size.
