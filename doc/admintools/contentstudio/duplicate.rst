.. NOTE::
   This page is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

This action will make a copy of the selected content and add "-copy" to the duplicate's path name. The only other difference between the
original and duplicate will be the content ID. Even the **Created** and **Modified** dates will be the same. This option is disabled when
more than one content is selected in the tree grid.
