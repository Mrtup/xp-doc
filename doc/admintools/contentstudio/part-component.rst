Part component
==============

.. NOTE::
   This section is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

Part components are created in the application code. They are reusable, configurable components that can be placed into any region of a page
with the :ref:`page_editor`. This allows content editors to build and customize pages without writing any code.

The first step in adding a part component to a page is to edit the content and open the inspection panel's "Insert" tab. Drag the part
component placeholder (puzzle piece) to the desired location on the page. The part placeholder will now appear as a blue box with a dropdown
selector. The same part dropdown selector will appear in the inspect panel. Use one of the selectors to find the desired part component.
Once a part component is selected, the Inspect panel will show the part's configuration options in a form. Some parts won't have any
configuration.
