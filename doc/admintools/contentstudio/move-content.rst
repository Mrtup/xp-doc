Move content
============

.. NOTE::
   This page is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

The toolbar's "Move" button opens the **Move item with children** dialogue. This feature moves selected items with all children and current
permissions to another place in the tree grid. Type to search, or use the dropdown arrow, to find the new parent content where the selected
items will be moved to. If the "Move" button in the dialogue is clicked without choosing a parent content then the items will be moved to
the root of the content tree. Content cannot be moved to a location where another content already exists with the same path name.
