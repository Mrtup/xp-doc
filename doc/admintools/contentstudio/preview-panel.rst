Preview panel
=============

.. NOTE::
   This page is under construction. This information is likely incomplete and possibly inaccurate until this notice is removed.

A preview of the selected content appears in the middle of the page if a site **page template** supports the type of content selected. This
is a working preview so links will take you to other pages and highlight the new page content in the content tree grid. The **Preview**
button in the toolbar will open the page in a new browser tab. When more than one content is selected in the content tree grid, the preview
panel is replaced with a list of the selected content.

.. NOTE::
   Only the **Draft** version of content is visible in the preview panel.
