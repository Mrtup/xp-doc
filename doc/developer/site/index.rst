Site Components
===============

Sites are developed in apps.  In the :ref:`apps-basics-project`, an overview of the file structure for an app is given.
This structure is rooted in the ``site`` folder, even though it is an app, because the app is a component in a site.

Below is more information about the different components used to build a site in an app.

    :maxdepth: 1

    configuration
    view
    page/index
    part/index
    layout/index
    service
    error

To add logic and flow, and make these components work together, check out our chapter on :ref:`serverside_javascript`.
