Content Types
=============

To enable simple configuration and setup of publishing forms, validation and data types - Enonic XP ships with a content api. Central to this api are Content Types.
Structured, indexed and searchable content items are created from Content types. Content Types build on the :ref:`schema_forms` concept, so they are very similar to other configurable forms in Enonic XP.
