Rendering a View
================

Instead of composing the HTML output in your controller, it's much
easier to pass the model down to a view. We support pluggable view
technologies and support the following out of the box:

* Thymeleaf (see ``lib-thymeleaf`` in :ref:`js-libraries`)
* Mustache (see ``lib-mustache`` in :ref:`js-libraries`)
* Xslt (see ``lib-xslt`` in :ref:`js-libraries`)
