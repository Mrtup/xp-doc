A page can be composed of parts and layouts or just be a simple page without
the compositions. To create a page, you will have to add a descriptor,
a controller and optionally a view. They should be placed in the folder ``site/pages/[page-name]``

   :maxdepth: 1

   descriptor
   controller
   render-view
   dynamic-content
   regions
