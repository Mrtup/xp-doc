Rendering a View
================

Instead of composing the HTML output in your controller, it's much
easier to pass the model down to a view. We support pluggable view
technologies and support the following out of the box:

* Thymeleaf (see :ref:`script-commands-thymeleaf`)
* Mustache (see :ref:`script-commands-mustache`)
* Xslt (see :ref:`script-commands-xslt`)
