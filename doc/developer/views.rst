Views
=====

Instead of composing the HTML, JSON or other output's in your javascript controllers,
it's often easier to use a full MVC (Model View Controller) approach.

Enonic XP supports pluggable view technologies, and ship the following view libraries out-of-the-box.

* Thymeleaf - typically for use with HTML (see ``lib-thymeleaf`` in :ref:`js-libraries`)
* Mustache - typically for use with JSON (see ``lib-mustache`` in :ref:`js-libraries`)
* Xslt - recommended used for XML processing (see ``lib-xslt`` in :ref:`js-libraries`)
