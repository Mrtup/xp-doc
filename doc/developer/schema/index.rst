Schemas
=======

Schemas define the building blocks of the data and site structure.
Content types, mixins and relationship types are data structures defined by schemas.  These are explained here.

Schemas also include the ``site.xml``-file that defines the whole site, and the descriptors for the pages, parts and layout elements.
For more on these schemas, see: :ref:`site_components`.
