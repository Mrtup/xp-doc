Localization
============

Enonic XP provides a standard approach to code localizations, simply by adding resource bundles to your applications, and actively using the ``localize``
functions in "controllers" and "views". Content localization currently requires building separate structures - we are working on process tools to simplify this in future releases.

To see how this is used in a controller, see ``lib-i18n`` in :ref:`js-libraries`.
