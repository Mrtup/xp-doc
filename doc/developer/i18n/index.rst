Localization
============

Multi-language support for text on a site can be enabled by adding a localization resource bundle to the module. The
localization resource bundle contains files with custom localized phrases which can be accessed through ``localize``
functions in the "controllers" and "view" files.

To see how this is used in a controller, see ``lib-i18n`` in :ref:`js-libraries`.
