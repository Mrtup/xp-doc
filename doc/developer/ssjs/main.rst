Main Initializer
================

When an application starts it can trigger some code. If you add a ``main.js`` file to the root of your application
this file is executed when the application starts. Here it's possible to add various initalization code or
add event listeners to listen for events.

Simple example:

.. literalinclude:: code/main-1.js
    :language: javascript

Running code on stop:

.. literalinclude:: code/main-2.js
    :language: javascript
