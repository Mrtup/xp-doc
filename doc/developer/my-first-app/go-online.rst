Now that your "Hello World" is complete, it's time to publish.

#. Select the "Hello World" site in the content pane
#. Click "Publish" from the right-click menu, or the toolbar
#. From the publishing wizard, remember to check the "Include children" checkbox
#. Verifying that all your items are listed  - click "Publish"!

When clicking publish, all the selected items and changes are "cloned" from draft and into the master branch (:ref:`node-domain-repository`).

You will always see the draft version of content in the preview window and with the preview function of the :ref:`content-content-manager`.
If you have placed your site on root level, you can also see your live site at this url:
``http://localhost:8080/admin/portal/preview/master/hello-world``.
