Now that your "Hello World" is complete, it's time to publish.

#. Select the "Hello World" site in the content pane
#. Select "Publish" from the right-click menu, or click the "Publish" button in the toolbar
#. The Publishing Wizard will appear. Check the "Include children" checkbox
#. Verify that all your items are listed  - click "Publish"!

When publishing content, all the selected items and changes are "cloned" from draft to the master branch (:ref:`node-domain-repository`).

You will always see the draft version of content in the preview window and with the preview function of the :ref:`content-content-manager`.
If you have placed your site on root level, you can also see your live site at this url:
``http://localhost:8080/portal/master/hello-world``.

things you will make and are always looking for `feedback <https://discuss.enonic.com>`_.
