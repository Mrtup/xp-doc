This tutorial only covered the basics of app development. Explore the documentation for more in-depth coverage.

Check our `GitHub <https://github.com/enonic>`_ page for examples of more advanced apps. The
`Xeon <https://github.com/enonic/app-xeon-onepager>`_ app is fairly simple but still much more advanced than this. The
`Superhero <https://github.com/enonic/app-superhero-blog>`_ blog app is also a good place to see more advanced code.

Visit our `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/user/EnonicCommunity>`_ chanel for training videos.
