Ordering results
================
	
Any user-defined or system-field can be used to order the result, either (default) DESC (descending) or ASC (ascending).
The default field for ordering are *_score*


_score
------

The score-value is calculated based on a number of factors, e.g number of matching clauses in boolean expressions, how often does the term appears in the documents when searching for text etc.
See elasticsearch-documentation for more insight.
