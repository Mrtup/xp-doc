Applications
============

Enonic XP supports the concept of Applications - almost like a regular operating system. Apps can be installed, started, stopped and uninstalled.
Applications are basically containers of functionality and code, but they may also include data - for instance to be imported when the application is started.
Applications can even be used to build sites.

In this chapter you will learn the basics of building applications, and the standard tools available to get the job done!
