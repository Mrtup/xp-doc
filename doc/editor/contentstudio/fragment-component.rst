Fragment component
==================

Fragments are created as content from an instance of another component. What makes a fragment special is that it uses the same configuration
on every page where it's added. When a fragment content is altered, the change is instantly visible on every page that uses it. All of the
other components are independently configured.

Creating fragments
------------------

Fragments can be created from any component on a page. When a fragment is created, it makes a content copy of the part, layout, image or
text component. In the page editor, right-click the desired component and select "Create fragment" from the context menu. The new fragment
content is created as a child of the page being edited. The fragment content will open in a new editor tab where its name and configuration
can be changed. At the same time, the component that was copied is replaced with the new fragment.

Using fragments
---------------

Once a fragment content has been created, it can be added to pages with the page editor. Drag a fragment placeholder from the "Insert" tab
of the :ref:`inspection_panel` to the desired location on the page. Use the dropdown selector in the placeholder to find the desired
fragment content. Once selected, the fragment will appear.
