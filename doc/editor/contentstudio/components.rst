Component types
===============

Enonic XP has five types of components that can be added to regions on a page. These component types are listed under the "Insert" tab of
the page editor. This section covers each type of component in detail. See the :ref:`page_editor` and :ref:`inspection_panel` pages for more
information about editing pages.
