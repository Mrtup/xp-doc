Create Content
==============

All content created with the Content Studio begins with the **Create Content** dialogue. This dialogue has two functions. First it assists
the user with finding the type of content to be created. Second, it opens the edit view in a new internal tab.

There are three ways to open the **Create Content** dialogue in the Content Studio. The first method is with the shortcut - **alt + n**. The
other methods require selecting the **New** button in the toolbar or in the context menu that appears when right-clicking an existing
content in the tree grid.

Content will be created as a child of whichever content was selected in the tree grid when the Create Content dialogue was opened. If no
content was selected, the new content will be created at the root of the repository. Usually, only **Site** contents are created at the
root.

Search field
------------

The search field can be used to quickly find a content type.

File and image upload
---------------------

To the right of the search field is an upload button represented by an icon with an up arrow. Clicking this icon will open the user's file
browser so one or more files can be selected from the file system. The type of content created will depend on the type of file selected.
Files can also be dragged and dropped onto the Create Content dialogue. A new edit view tab will open for each selected file so that
meta-data can be entered.

Most Popular
------------

If the parent content has one or more existing child items, the most used type of child content will appear with a blue background at the
top of the content type list. The number of this type of child content is in parenthesis.

Content type list
-----------------

All content types of the installed applications are listed on the left side of the Create Content dialogue. The list is instantly updated as
characters are typed into the search field. Each item in the list has the content type icon, Display Name of the content type, and the full
app name of the content type. It is possible for two applications to have a content type with the same Display Name, so the full app name
would be helpful to tell them apart.

Recently Used
-------------

The right side of the dialogue will list the recently used types of content.
