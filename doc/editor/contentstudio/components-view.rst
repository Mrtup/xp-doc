Component View
==============

This tool opens in a draggable internal window activated by the clipboard icon in the toolbar. It displays a hierarchical tree
representation of all the components and regions on the page, including the page itself. This tool is extremely valuable in situations when
an unconfigured component does not render or content structure is complex or device resolution is very small.

Selecting a component in the tree will highlight the component in the page editor and display its configuration in the inspection panel's
**Inspect tab**. The triangle on the right of each component will open a menu of options that can be selected for the component. The menu
options available depend on the component selected, but may include: **Insert** for inserting other components, **Reset** to reset the
component's configuration, **Remove**, **Duplicate** and **Create fragment**.

Components can be rearranged directly in the tree with drag'n'drop function.

In the image below, a part named **Meta** is selected in the Components view and the part is highlighted with a black border at the bottom
of the page editor. The Meta part's configuration is visible in the inspect panel on the right.
