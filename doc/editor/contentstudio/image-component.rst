Image component
===============

The Image component allows content editors to place an image into any region on a page without writing any code.

In the :ref:`page_editor`, drag an Image component placeholder from the inspect panel to the desired region on the page. Once placed, the
empty image placeholder contains an image selector that can be used to find and select any previously uploaded image content. If the name of
the image is known, simply start typing it in the box to filter the list of images. If the name is not known, use the down arrow to open a
list of images to choose from. Note that the list will contain all image content items in the XP installation, including images that were
created in a different site of a multi-site environment.


If the desired image does not already exist as a content, simply upload it with the button on the right side of the image selector dropdown.
The new image content will be created as a child of the page being edited, but it could be moved later if needed.

The inspect panel will also show the dropdown image selector as well as a text area for writing an image caption. If a caption is entered,
it will appear below the image.
