Unstructured
============

Unstructured content cannot be edited in the Content Studio except for the display name, the content name, and the settings and security.
Content of this type is meant to be used by applications to store data when the structure is not known. Form entries are often stored as
unstructured content to avoid the need to create a custom content type for each form on a site. The stored data cannot be viewed in the
Content Studio without a custom page component or page template that supports the Unstructured content type.
