Defining a Content-Type
=======================

Content-Types allow the creation of structured content. They are defined in XML and processed to generate forms for web
editors to add content to the site without writing any code.

Create a folder called ``person`` in the ``content-types`` folder. Then create a file called ``content-type.xml`` inside the
``person`` folder. Fill it out as follows:

.. literalinclude:: code/content-type.xml
   :language: xml

Save the following image with the name ``thumb.png`` and place it in the ``content-type/person`` folder. It will become the icon for
the ``person`` content-type in the admin console.

.. image:: images/thumb.png
